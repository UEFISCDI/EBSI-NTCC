# Instroduction

The European Blockchain Services Infrastructure (EBSI) is an initiative of the European Union to leverage blockchain technology for cross-border services to public administrations. 
EBSI's goals are aligned with the broader objectives of the European Digital Strategy which is built on three pillars:
+ Business: Several domains benefit from using blockchain as base of their business process
+ Technology: All transactions are recorded on the EBSI ledger and follow the same path
+ Infrastructure: The infrastructure is decentralized instead of relying on a unique database

The EBSI-NE Consortium supports the development and adoption of the EBSI network at the European level following two main actions:
+ Infrastructure: Implement and operate the decentralized nodes by increasing the number of validation nodes within the production network
+ Technical Support services: providing support services to all relevant EBSI stakeholders by promoting a framework for building and operating National Technical Competence Centers (NTCC)

# Purpose and goals

These Technical Competences Centers were created with the primary goal of offering first-line support to ensure operational success in implementing blockchain-based services in their regions of operation and act as an offload point of contact of EBSI Support Desk services, the general maintainer of EBSI Network infrastructure.
NTCCs are designed to fulfil several functions within the EBSI framework, including technical support, security services, training for technical operations, policy and standardization of technical support, interoperability enhancement, collaboration and networking.
